description: Start the development server
---

To start the development server and begin working on the project:

// turbo
1. Run `pnpm run dev` in the terminal.
2. The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Open the browser to view the application.

*Note: TanStack Router will automatically generate `src/routeTree.gen.ts` as you add or modify files in `src/routes/`. Keep the dev server running for this to work.*
